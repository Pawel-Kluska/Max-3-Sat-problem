Final project for a course of Effective Programming Techniques from Politechnika Wroc≈Çawska. 
The purpose for this project is to find best possible solution of Max-3-Sat problem. This program takes instances of problem from file, then
uses genetic optimizer (genetic algorithm) to choose best solution from population. Program runs for several minutes and then return the results.
